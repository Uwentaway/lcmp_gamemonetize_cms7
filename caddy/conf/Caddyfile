# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

#smbo.tech www.smbo.tech {
sigops.us.kg www.sigops.us.kg {
	# Set this path to your site's directory.
	#root * /usr/share/caddy
	root * /var/www/html

	# Enable the static file server.
	file_server
        php_fastcgi php-fpm:9000
    
        # 启用日志
        log {
            output file /var/log/caddy/access.log
        }

	# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
	# reverse_proxy localhost:8080

	# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
	# php_fastcgi localhost:9000
}
